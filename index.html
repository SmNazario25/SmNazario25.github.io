	<blockquote>
	“A lady clad in teal, aged by 17 summers, did witness <strong>The Great Atrocity.</strong> A great dragon burst forth from the sky and blanketed the land in a fiery wrath. A great confusion befell the people as demons under the guise of men laid waste to the crowds. <em>The lady</em> had interfered with one of the demons who attempted to steal the life of another. A bolt was received on her forehead. It was then that <strong><em>The Maiden of Blood</em></strong> did receive the truth of the world. Her third eye revealing what people have been blind to since time began.”</blockquote><p align="center">– an excerpt from the <i>Tome of Somna</i>, recovered in the ruins of the Stilnes Woods</p>

	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	
<p>For hundreds of years, information pertaining to what many call <strong>“The Great Atrocity”</strong> had been lost to modern civilization. During the last few months of my investigation, I have managed to find more information than I would have ever hoped to dream. Of course, most of the information presented can only be taken at face value, however, there is always a logical explanation to works such as these. This is an archive of all my findings as well as a personal diary of my thoughts on the matter. Please feel free to browse through this information and use it <em>(with proper citation)</em> to your heart’s content.</p>
